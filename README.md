# MoveSpeed
World of Warcraft addon to show your character's movement speed in WoW.

Click and drag to move around.

If you're standing still, it shows 0%. You can click and drag this frame anywhere you want and it should stay there. To see the number change, move your character!

It has support for libdatabroker, so you can use it with titanpanel or whatever the kids use these days.

## Slash Commands
```/movespeed reset```
This moves the frame to 0,0 (center of your screen)

```/movespeed bg``` This adds a background to the frame. I used this to see if it was overlapping another frame.

```/movespeed bgoff``` This removes the background we added earlier.

```/movespeed small``` Makes the text smaller.

```/movespeed large``` Makes the text larger.

```/movespeed hide``` Hides the frame.

```/movespeed show``` Brings the frame back!
