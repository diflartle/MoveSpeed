# MoveSpeed
World of Warcraft addon to show your character's movement speed in WoW.

Click and drag to move around.

[Latest relase](https://github.com/diflartle/MoveSpeed/releases/tag/v1.0.1)

## Slash Commands
```/movespeed reset```
This moves the frame to 0,0 (center of your screen)

```/movespeed bg``` This adds a background to the frame. I used this to see if it was overlapping another frame.

```/movespeed bgoff``` This removes the background we added earlier.
